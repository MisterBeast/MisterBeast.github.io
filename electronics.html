<div class="d"><br>
<font0>
We believe that the most hard thing in starting anything is to do the first step. We want to make this step being for you really easy. Totally!	
<br><br>
Hopefully, it is the first easily understandable book on Electronics for all girls and boys age 8+. Also, of course, it is the best entry point for anyone more adult who wants to start understanding and making Electronics.
<br><br>
By the way, we practice <b>redundancy</b> throughout this book, using very simple words and sometimes explaining the same things several times.

<fontHeading id="Electronics"><center>&nbsp&nbspWhat&nbspis&nbspElcectronics&nbspindeed?&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</center></fontHeading>
<font0>
Electronics is the process of making pure magic — it is so, not being an overstatement.
<br><br>

What really happens is that we take dead things — metal things and semi-metal things — next, we combine them, and then we get some ... thing, some <b>dead organism</b> (some so-called Circuit):
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="simplecircuit.png" height="400"><!--
<img src="multiv.png" height="400">-->
</center>

Next, we leanch blood into this dead organism — in the technological world, blood is an Electric Current — so we leanch an Electrical Current into this dead organism (this Circuit) and it becomes <b>alive</b>:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="simplecircuit_1.png" height="400"><!--
<img src="multiv.gif" height="400">-->
</center>
<!--
In fact, while making Electronics we create alive organisms we can control.
<br><br>-->

For example, you can create a simple organism (simple Electric circuit) — having its own behavior — that can live very long:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="10years.gif" height="400">
</center>
<br>
Really, you can create an <b>alive organism</b> that can live very long without any of your support, only on its own — with its own heart pumping the blood around. 
<br><br>
But, of course, it will be so only if YOU want this organism to live so.
<br><br>
It is the Level Of God.
<br><br>
We (authors) believe that Electricity — Electric Current — is probably the most promise thing in the universe. Still the most promise thing in the universe.
<br><br>
So Electronics is when we vitalize dead things and then control the lives of those alive organisms.
<br><br>
Electric Circuits are buildings blocks for building all Robots, meaning that Electric Circuits are the basis of <a href="book3.html#Robots" target = "_blank">Robotics</a>. It is why Electronics is so important.
<br><br>
<!--
The question arises — But how exactly can it all work?

<font0>
Let's take a glass saucepan like this:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="saucepan.png" height="300">
</center>
<br>
and do some changes with it:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="glasspan3.png" height="100">
</center>
<br>
So, we have got such a glass cylinder with a glass tube:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="cylinder.png" height="200">
</center>
<br>
Let's take 2 such glass cylinders:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="two.png" height="200">
</center>
<br>
Okay.
<br><br>
And let's take a so called "hot water bottle":
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="hotwaterbottle.png" height="200">
</center>
<br>
Okay.
<br><br>


Have you ever seen that a hot water bottle may be being inflated?
<br><br>
<center>
<iframe width=100% height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmPl50wBbUA?rel=0&start=6&end=46" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>
<div align="right"><a style="color: gray">40 sec watch</a>
</div>


Now you likely have.
<br><br>


Next, let's close those glass cylinders with that rubber material (similar to the one into a rubber bed warmer) like this:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="two_cover.png" height="200">
</center>
<br>
So we have got 2 containers. And each of these containers has elastic parts.

Okay.
<br><br>
Next, let's fill these containers with green liquid — with green water, for example — like this:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="lc_00000.png" height="200">
</center>
<br>
Next, by some tool let's inject some green liquid into one container and suck some green liquid from other container:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="lc_0000.png" height="200">
</center>
<br>
And next, let's bridge these containers by a glass tube filled with green liquid:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="lc_00.png" width="100%">
</center>
<br>
Now, what do you think will happen there when we open the valve:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="valve.png" width= 200px>
</center>
<br>
Exactly!
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="open.png" width="100%">
</center>
<br>
The green liquid will be flowing from the left container to the right container.
<br><br>

Of course, the green liquid will be flowing until there will be an equal amount of the green liquid in both the containers.
<br><br>
It is easy. Easy to understand this process.
<br><br>
In reality, flowing of that green liquid is nearly the same how Electric Current is flowing: 
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="thesame.png" width= 600px>
</center>
<br>
Flowing of that green liquid <b>inside the glass tube</b> is nearly the same how Electric Current is flowing <b>inside the metal wire</b>.
<br><br>
Indeed, <b>injecting</b> the green liquid into the glass tube and  <b>sucking</b> the green liquid from the glass tube is nearly the same how the <b>Buttery works</b>:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="baterryworks.png" width= 900px>
</center>
<br>
As we can see, our 2 containers work exactly like 2 pumps -- the left container like a pump is <b>injecting</b> the green liquid into the glass tube and the right container like a pump is <b>sucking</b> the green liquid from the glass tube.
<br><br>
Similarly, the 2 ends of any Electric Battery always work exactly like these 2 pumps do  — the left pump is <b>injecting</b> the green liquid into the tube and the right pomp is <b>sucking</b> the green liquid from the tube.
<br><br>
In other words, we might say that the left pump is creating high pressure on the left end of the tube and the right pomp is creating low pressure on the right end of the tube.
<br><br>
And only thanks to the difference of those pressure the green liquid is flowing through the tube:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="thanksto.png" width= 900px>
</center>
<br>
Now, please imagine that this green liquid consists of very small green balls — very, very small, <b>hard</b>, <b>slippery</b>, green balls.
<br><br>
Did you manage to imagine it?

<br><br>
Hopefully, you did.
<br><br>
The question arises — But how exactly can Electric Current be flowing?
<br><br>
<i>Spoiler</i> : Everything is building on magic pushes of those small green balls<!-- — on Energy of the pushes-->.

<br><br>
</font0>
</font0>

<fontHeading><center>Visible Pushes of Big Balls</center></fontHeading>
<font0>
We know <b>as a fact</b> that two big metal balls hanging, for example, on thin cotton strings and, simultaneously, being at a distance from each other, can be <b>pushing</b> each other:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="balls.png" height="300">
</center>
<br>
Sometimes, one of these metal ball can <b>be pushing</b> other metal ball <b>away from</b> itself, but sometimes, the same metal ball can be <b>pushing</b> other metal ball <b>closer to</b> itself.
<br><br>
<!--
Also, we know <b>as a fact</b> that they can be doing it even if there is not any air surrounding them — incl. there is not any air between and behind them.
<br><br>
-->
It is a fact, since we (people) have seen it many times. So we know it for sure.
<br><br>
But how can they do it?
<br><br>
We (people) have our own explanation for it.
<br><br>
Let’s start from the very beginning.
<br><br>
</font0>


<fontHeading><center>Green and Red small Balls</center></fontHeading>
<font0>
<br>
<center>
<img src="charges.png" height="300">
</center>
<br>
Scientists <b>suppose</b> that any metal object — for example, a metal wire or metal plate:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="wire.png" height="300"><img src="plate.png" height="300">
</center>
<br>

inside contains two sorts of very,very small balls:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="charges.png" height="300">
</center>
<br>
green balls and red balls.
<br><br>
<!--
The green balls are called Electrons and the red balls are called Protons.
<br><br>-->
Scientists suppose that the only thing these small balls can do is to push each other. To push each other, <b>being at a distance from each other</b>!
<br><br>
Inportantly, scientists DO NOT KNOW how  exactly these small balls push each other, being at a distance from each other!  
<br><br>
Scientists just suppose that these small balls exist inside metal objects — inside a metal wire or metal plate, for example — and can push each other.
<br><br>

So scientists suppose that each green ball always pushes other green ball away from itself — in other words, two green balls strive to go in opposite directions: 
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="electrons.png" height="100">
</center>
<br>

Scientists suppose that each red ball always pushes other red ball away from itself — in other words, two red balls also strive to go in opposite directions: 
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="protons.png" height="100">
</center>
<br>
But each green ball pushes each red ball closer to itself; and, <b>simultaneously</b>, each red ball pushes each green ball also closer to itself: 
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="electron_proton.png" height="100">
</center>
<br>
in other words, each green ball and each red ball both strive to go closer to each other.
<br><br>
Furthermore, with keeping it in mind, scientists also suppose that sometimes some green balls and red balls can create a system called Atom:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="atom.png" height="300">
</center>
<br>
As we can see, such a model of Atom implies that there is the heart of Atom — the central element — named <b>Nucleus</b>:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="440px-Nucleus_drawing.svg.png" height="300">
</center>
<br>
Anyway, as we can see, such a model of Atom also additionaly implies that there is some pushes that are holding the red balls together, not letting them fly in opposite directions away from each other.
<br><br>

Plus, such a model of Atom also implies that the green balls fly around Nucleus just like the planets fly around the Sun:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="atom.png" height="300">
</center>
<br>
But why do we ever think the planets — including our planet <b>Earth</b> — can fly around the Sun and do not go closer to the Sun, jumping out of their orbits. 
<br><br>
Or even more specifically, why do we think our planet <b>Earth</b> can fly around the Sun and does not go closer to the Sun, jumping out of the Earth's orbit. 

<br><br>
Here below is explanations to it. 


<br><br>

<button class="button" onclick="myFunction0()">

<br><br>
By the <a style="color: #6720DF"><b>1-st string</b></a> of code:
<br><br>
</div>




<br><br>
Okay.
<br><br>
So scientists suppose that the green balls fly around Nucleus just like the planets fly around the Sun.  Okay, let's say that.

<br><br>
Additionally, such a model of Atom also implies that in a single Atom there is the same number of the red balls and green balls.
<br><br>

</center>
<br>

So, scientists suppose that each single Atom is a system of the red and green balls.
<br><br>
-->
By the way, scientists call the red balls Protons and they call the green balls Electrons.
<br><br>
So, in other words, scientists suppose that each single Atom is a system of Protons and Electrons.
<br><br>
As we can see, such a model of Atom implies that each Proton goes around Nucleus at the radius of a specific size.
<br><br>
In other words, Protons go around Nucleus at the radii of different sizes.
<br><br>
Scientists suppose that those Protons that go around Nucleus at the maximal radius are on the least degree of being pushed closer to Nucleus and, it means, these Protons may go away from the Atom if there will be even insignificant pushes pushing the Protons away from the Atom.
<br><br>
Scientists suppose that each Proton that goes around Nucleus at the maximal radius is weakly being pushed closer to Nucleus and, it means, that Proton may go away from the Atom if there will be an even insignificant push pushing the Proton away from the Atom.
<br><br>

Let's do an experient! Experient  !!!
<br><br>
Let's take some Protons (green balls) away from Atoms of this iron big ball:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="ironball.png" height="200">
</center>
<br>
Scientists suppose that that iron big ball above is arranged inside much like a plastic green ball with green liquid inside:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="pball.png" height="200">
</center>
<br>
It is so since scientists, as we already know, suppose that those Protons that go around Nucleus at the maximal radius are on the least degree being of pushed closer to Nucleus and, it means, these Protons may go away from the Atom if there will be even insignificant pushes pushing the Protons away from the Atom. 
<br><br>
So Scientists believe that inside the iron ball these weakly-linked Protons build a sea of small green balls — the <b>sea</b> much like green liquid inside the plastic ball:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="ironball.png" height="200"><img src="pball.png" height="200">
</center>
<br>



Meet — this is a syringe!
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="sy0.png" height="300">
</center>
<br>
For example, this syringe can inject green liquid into that plastic ball <!--or, if we want,  can suck green liquid from the plastic ball-->:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="inject.png" height="500">
</center>
<br>
<i>By the way, a syringe is a glass tube with a piston and nozzle<!-- — meant for injecting liquid in something or for sucking liquid from something-->:</i>
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="sy.png" height="300">
</center>
<br>
So, by this good tool <b>syringe</b> we can inject green liquid into that plastic ball: 
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="inject.png" height="500">
</center>
<br>
But is there a syringe to inject green liquid into that iron ball: 
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="inject3.png" height="500">
</center>
<br>
It turns out yes, there is such a syringe.
<br><br>
Meet — this is another syringe!
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="hv.png" height="300">
</center>
<br>
It is a so-called high-voltage supply.
<br><br>
By this good tool indeed being a <b>syringe</b> we can inject green liquid into that iron ball: 
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="inject3.png" height="500">
</center>
<br>
Let's do it.

Let's inject green liquid into that iron ball:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="inject5.png" height="500">
</center>
<br>
After we have touched that iron ball by the green terminal, inside the iron ball there are now more green balls than red balls.
<br><br>
So, in this iron ball now there are more green balls than red balls.
Or, in other words, we might say that this iron ball is charged with green balls — is green-ball charged. 
<br><br>
<!--
has been charged with green balls. It means It is charged with green balls. It is green-ball charged. 
<br><br>
This iron object is charged with green balls. It is charged with green balls. It is green-ball charged. 
<br><br>
This iron object is charged with red balls. It is charged with red balls.
It is red-ball charged.
<br><br>
-->








Just watch we are doing and what will be happening there.
<br><br>




We go on.
<br><br>

Scientists suppose that any <b>metal</b> object — for example, any <b>iron</b> wire or any <b>iron</b> plate:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="wire.png" height="300"><img src="plate.png" height="300">
</center>
<br>
is composed of Atoms. Of lots of lots of lots of Atoms.
<br><br>


Scientists suppose that, for example, any <b>iron</b> object represents in a way a building composed of Atoms. Each single Atom there looks like this:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="atom.png" height="300">
<br></a><a style="color: gray"><i>A single Atom of any <b>iron</b> object</i></a>
</center>
<br>
· <b>26 Protons</b> (red balls) compressed together are at the centre of the Atom;<br>
· <b>26 Electrons</b> (green balls) fly around these Protons — around the Nucleus — just like planets fly around the Sun.

<br><br>
Also, for example, scientists suppose that any <b>copper</b> object represents in a way a building composed of Atoms looking like this:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="copper.png" height="300">
<br></a><a style="color: gray"><i>A single Atom of any <b>copper</b> object</i></a>
</center>
<br>
· <b>29 Protons</b> (red balls) compressed together are at the centre of the Atom;<br>
· <b>29 Electrons</b> (green balls) fly around these Protons — around the Nucleus — just like planets fly around the Sun.
<br><br>
Scientists suppose that, for example, any <b>aluminum</b> object represents in a way a building composed of Atoms. Each single Atom of any <b>aluminum</b> object looks like this:

<br><br>
<center>
<img src="al.png" height="250">
<br></a><a style="color: gray"><i>A single atom of any <b>aluminum</b> object</i></a>
</center>
<br>
· <b>13 Protons</b> (red balls) compressed together are at the centre of the Atom;<br>
· <b>13 Electrons</b> (green balls) fly around these Protons — around the Nucleus — just like planets fly around the Sun.<br>
<br><br>
A syringe is a glass tube with a piston and nozzle either for injecting green liquid in something  or for sucking green liquid from something:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="sy.png" height="300">
</center>
<br>
This iron object is charged with green balls. It is charged with green balls. It is green-ball charged. 
<br><br>
This iron object is charged with red balls. It is charged with red balls.
It is red-ball charged.

The invisible hand is appearing there out of wherever. Although this hand is invisible but pushes this hand may exert are real and we can feel them by our hand, for example or may see them while this invisible hand is pushing a tube.

<fontHeading><center>The Direction of an Electric Current</center></fontHeading>
<font0>A represantation of how in reality an Electric Current flows:
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="current.png" height="300">
</center>
<br>
Hmm ..., there are so many stupid things in science. One sort of them is the stupidity about the Direction of an Electric Current.
<br><br>
So-called scientists managed to so confuse things that we all are forced to speak that an Electric Current flows from the plus to minus electrode; but though in reality any Electric Current inside a metal wire flows precisely from the minus to plus electrode since Electrons (which ARE the Electric Current itself) flow exactly from the minus to plus electrode.
<br><br>
Since all existing electronic schemes around the world are indeed wrong for now — since they all tell us that an Electric Current flows from the plus to minus electrode which is absolutely false as we now understand — in order to not rebuild all these electronic schemes and to not break your brain we (authors) will use here to speak that Electrons flow from the plus to minus electrode, although Electrons indeed flow from minus to plus electrode.
<br><br>
Hopefully, it all above was understandable.
